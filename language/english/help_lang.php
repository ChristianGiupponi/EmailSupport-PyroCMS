<h1>Support Email</h1>
<p>Thanks for downloading the Support email module for PyroCMS.</p>
<br>
<h3>How to use the module</h3>
<p>
	To use this module you need to insert your email address in the code of  the module, you need to edit the addons/shared_addons/modules/supporto/controller/admin.php file at line 30 or in the SITE_REF folder
	<br>
	In this way you can use the module on every site you want.
</p>
<h3>Why I need to edit the file?</h3>
<p>
	I have decided to let you edit the file because this module is oriented to the developers. Often developers just create the site and gave full controll at the site to the customers and, probably, they insert the customer email in the setting to allow them to send and receive emails.
	<br>
	In this way the developer can set in settings the costumer email and its own in the file to ensure that the costumer will send to him the questions.
